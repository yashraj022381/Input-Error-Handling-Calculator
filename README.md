# Input-Error-Handling-Calculator

A calculator with error handling prevents crashes and provides helpful feedback when unexpected input or operations occur. 
This involves checks for invalid input, like non-numeric values or division by zero, and displays informative messages to the user instead of crashing. 

Key aspects of error handling in a calculator:-

1.Input Validation:
  - Check if the input is a valid number before attempting calculations.
  - Handle cases where the user enters text instead of numbers, or if the input is incomplete.

2.Arithmetic Errors:
  - Specifically handle division by zero, which would normally cause a runtime error.
  - Display a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

3.Error Propagation:
  - If an error occurs within a function, it should be returned or thrown as an exception, allowing the calling function to          handle it.
  - This prevents errors from being silently ignored.

4.User Feedback:
  - Provide clear and informative error messages to the user.
  - Consider providing options to correct the error, such as clearing the input or re-entering the values.

ALGORITHM:
step 1: start.

step 2: Enter a first number.

step 3: Select any mathematical operators to perform mathematical operation given in list like(+, -, *, /).

step 4. Enter a second number.

step 5: exit.


step 1:
